# Goal Harness Meta Goal

## Objective

Keep the public Goal Harness project healthy enough that another local Codex
thread can bootstrap a goal, inspect registry and run history, check public
boundary safety, and render a first-screen status queue without relying on any
private project context.

## Current Scope

- Keep `goal-harness bootstrap`, `goal-harness check`, `goal-harness status`,
  and `goal-harness serve-status` runnable from a fresh clone.
- Keep docs and examples aligned with the current CLI surface.
- Keep public examples sanitized: no local user paths, private documents,
  credentials, raw logs, or internal task identifiers.
- Treat project-specific adapters as private until their contract is generic
  enough to document publicly.

## Next Action

- Add a contract-health detail surface to the dashboard so an operator can see
  blocking errors, non-blocking warnings, and recent check evidence before
  choosing the next goal action.

## Recent Progress

- 2026-06-01T11:43:29+08:00: Added `docs/status-data-contract.md`,
  linked it from README / architecture / attention queue / integration docs,
  pushed the public commit, and saved a compact self-health run with
  `health_check=22/22`.
- 2026-06-01T11:48:36+08:00: Added
  `examples/render-status-dashboard.py`, documented the static dashboard demo,
  and validated that `examples/status.example.json` renders to a local HTML
  dashboard with user/controller, Codex-ready, and external-evidence lanes.
- 2026-06-01T11:59:59+08:00: Added
  `docs/dashboard-frontend-selection.md`, reframed the single-file HTML
  renderer as a diagnostic fallback, and selected a React/Vite/shadcn/TanStack
  stack for the product dashboard after benchmarking observability and
  orchestration consoles.
- 2026-06-01T12:05:18+08:00: Scaffolded `apps/dashboard` as a Vite + React +
  TypeScript app that reads `examples/status.example.json`, validates it with
  Zod, renders status lanes, metrics, a Recharts queue chart, and a sortable
  TanStack Table behind URL-backed TanStack Router filters.
- 2026-06-01T12:15:37+08:00: Validated the dashboard scaffold with
  `npm --prefix apps/dashboard run build`, browser smoke checks for the
  `Goal Operations` screen, and a public contract scan over the repo. Updated
  the contract scanner to skip `node_modules` so the new npm app remains
  compatible with `--scan-root .`.
- 2026-06-01T12:21:11+08:00: Added dashboard status source controls. The app
  now keeps `examples/status.example.json` as a fallback, accepts a
  URL-backed status source through `statusUrl`, loads imported JSON files, and
  validates every loaded payload with the same Zod status data contract.
- 2026-06-01T12:28:37+08:00: Validated the status source path with a generated
  `apps/dashboard/public/status.local.json` export and a browser smoke check at
  `?statusUrl=/status.local.json`. Added dashboard docs plus a `.gitignore`
  guard so local status exports stay untracked.
- 2026-06-01T12:37:47+08:00: Added `goal-harness serve-status`, a loopback HTTP
  server for live dashboard status JSON with `/status.json`, `/healthz`,
  no-store responses, and local CORS headers. The React dashboard now has a
  default `Live` source path for `http://127.0.0.1:8765/status.json`.
- 2026-06-01T12:47:47+08:00: Added compact run-history to the public
  `goal-harness status` contract, stripping local artifact paths while exposing
  recent classifications, health check summaries, and JSON/Markdown artifact
  availability. The React dashboard now lets an operator select an attention
  queue row and inspect the corresponding run-history detail panel.

## Validation

- `python3 -m py_compile goal_harness/*.py`
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --help`
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --format json check --scan-root .`
- Parse all JSON examples in `examples/`.
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --format json check --scan-path README.md --scan-path docs/dashboard-frontend-selection.md --scan-path docs/status-data-contract.md`
- `cd apps/dashboard && npm run build`
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --format json status > apps/dashboard/public/status.local.json`
- Browser smoke: load `http://127.0.0.1:5173/?statusUrl=/status.local.json`
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli serve-status --help`
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/healthz`
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/status.json`
- Browser smoke: click `Live` in `apps/dashboard` and verify it loads
  `http://127.0.0.1:8765/status.json`
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --format json status` includes `run_history`
  without local path keys
- Browser smoke: click `docs-maintenance-goal` in the attention queue and
  verify the run-history panel switches to the no-run state

## Guards

- Do not copy private registry entries, project paths, document links, task ids,
  credentials, or raw run payloads into public examples.
- Keep runtime data local; commit only sanitized docs, source, and examples.
- Prefer small, verified public-facing changes over broad rewrites.
